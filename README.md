## Python Beginnings – Semester 1

This repository (`python-beginnings-sem1`) is a collection of small Python programs and examples intended for absolute beginners, typically for a first–semester introduction to programming in Python. The examples cover core language fundamentals: variables, data types, operators, conditionals, loops, functions, and basic string/list/tuple operations.

## Contents

- **Root Python files**: Step‑by‑step basic programs:
  - `01python_basics.py` – very first Python statements and printing.
  - `02variable_assignment.py`, `03multiple_variable_assignment.py` – working with variables and multiple assignment.
  - `04boolean_operations.py` – Boolean expressions and logical operators.
  - `05float_conversion.py` – numeric types and type conversion.
  - `06format_ord_chr_demo.py` – formatting output, `ord()` and `chr()` demonstrations.
  - `07eval_input.py` – taking input and using `eval()` (for learning purposes only).
  - `08string_basics.py` – basic string operations.
  - `09if_else_even_odd.py` to `12if_else_arithmetic_menu.py` – `if`/`else` decision‑making examples.
  - `13loops_factorial_of_number.py`, `14loops_fibonacci_and_even_sum.py` – loop constructs with classical problems.
  - `15reverse_4digit_number.py`, `16reverse_digits_stepwise.py`, `17reverse_string_using_slicing.py` – reversing numbers and strings.
  - `18prime_number_check.py`, `19palindrome_string_check.py`, `20armstrong_number_check.py`, `21strong_number_check.py`, `22perfect_number_and_square.py` – number property checks.
  - `23area_of_rectangle.py`, `24kilometers_to_miles.py`, `25salary_calculation_med_rep.py`, `26percentage_and_grade_notes.py` – small arithmetic/real‑life style problems.
  - `27practice.py` – additional practice problems (may vary over time).

- **`functions/` directory**: Examples focused on functions:
  - `01function_basics.py` – defining and calling simple functions.
  - `02function_arguments.py` – positional and other argument styles.
  - `03local_and_global_variables.py` – scope rules.
  - `04return_statement_examples.py` – returning values from functions.
  - `05math_module_examples.py` – using the standard `math` module.
  - `06recursion_examples.py` – basic recursion patterns.

- **`string_list_tuple/` directory**: Core sequence types:
  - `01string_examples.py` – string operations, indexing, slicing.
  - `02list_examples.py` – lists, common methods, and iteration.
  - `03tuple_examples.py` – tuples and their properties.

## Prerequisites

- **Python**: Any recent Python 3 version (3.8+ recommended).
- **Environment**: You can run these scripts with:
  - A terminal/command prompt, or
  - An IDE like VS Code, PyCharm, or tools like IDLE / Jupyter.

Check your Python version:

```bash
python --version
```

On some systems you may need:

```bash
python3 --version
```

---

## How to Run the Programs

1. **Clone the repository** (if you are using Git):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Raghavgupta2003/python-beginnings-sem1.git
cd python-beginnings-sem1
```

2. **Run an individual script**:

```bash
python 13loops_factorial_of_number.py
```

or, depending on your system:

```bash
python3 13loops_factorial_of_number.py
```

3. **Using an IDE**:
   - Open the folder `python-beginnings-sem1` in your IDE.
   - Open any `.py` file you want to explore.
   - Run the file using the IDE’s run/debug button.

Many files use `input()` for interactive input; run them in a terminal or an IDE that supports stdin so you can type values when prompted.

## Intended Audience

- Students taking their **first semester** of programming.
- Self‑learners who want **small, focused Python examples** rather than large projects.
- Anyone revising **fundamentals** of Python syntax and core concepts.

The scripts are intentionally simple and mostly self‑contained so they’re easy to read and modify.

## Suggested Learning Path

1. **Start with basics**
   - Run and experiment with: `01python_basics.py` → `06format_ord_chr_demo.py`.
2. **Conditionals and loops**
   - Explore `09if_else_even_odd.py` through `14loops_fibonacci_and_even_sum.py`.
3. **Number/property problems**
   - Try the prime, palindrome, Armstrong, strong, and perfect number examples.
4. **Functions**
   - Move into the `functions/` directory and study how code can be reused.
5. **Strings, lists, tuples**
   - Use the `string_list_tuple/` examples to learn common operations on sequences.

Feel free to modify any script, add print statements, or create your own variations to deepen your understanding.
